üëã Hello, fellow programmers! Welcome to my GitHub profile. Let me introduce myself and provide some insights into my background, experience, and interests.

About Me

üå± My name is Rita Almeida (@ritaalmeida96), and I'm currently transitioning into a role as a Software Engineer in Test. My journey in programming began during high school when I pursued a professional course to become a Computer Systems Programming technician. During this time, I gained experience in various programming languages, including Portugol (algorithms), Pascal, C++, C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Interests and Expertise

üëÄ While I thoroughly enjoy software testing, my ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between testing and development by becoming a proficient test automation engineer. I'm focused on using Python with Selenium to automate tests and improve software quality. I believe that combining my testing expertise with programming skills will enable me to contribute to robust and efficient software development processes.

Projects

üíûÔ∏è To enhance my programming skills further, I'm currently working on projects with the guidance of Codecademy. This platform allows me to refresh my memory on various programming languages and explore different aspects of software development. Stay tuned for some exciting projects coming up!
