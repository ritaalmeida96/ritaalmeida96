üëã Hello, fellow programmers! Welcome to my GitHub profile. Allow me to introduce myself and provide you with some insights into my background, experience, and interests.

 ## About Me

üå± My name is Rita Almeida (@ritaalmeida96), and I currently work as a manual software tester (QA analyst). I have a foundation in programming, which began during my high school years when I pursued a professional course to become a Computer Systems Programming technician. 
During this time, I gained experience in various programming languages, including Portugol (algorithms), Pascal, C++, C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Interests and Expertise

üëÄ  Though I thoroughly enjoy my role in software testing, my ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between testing and development by becoming a proficient test automation engineer. 
My focus is on using Python with Selenium to automate tests and improve software quality. I believe that combining my testing expertise with programming skills will enable me to contribute to robust and efficient software development processes.

 ## Projects

üíûÔ∏è To further enhance my programming skills, I am currently working on projects with the guidance of Codecademy. This platform allows me to refresh my memory on various programming languages and explore different aspects of software development. 
Stay tuned for some exciting projects coming up!

## Skills and Technologies

- Test Plan Development: I am skilled in creating comprehensive test plans that cover all aspects of software testing and ensure maximum test coverage.
- Specification Analysis: I possess a keen eye for detail and excel at analyzing project specifications to identify potential test scenarios and corner cases.
- Bug Reporting: I have experience in accurately reporting and documenting software defects, aiding in their timely resolution.
